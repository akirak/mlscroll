# MLScroll
A lightweight scrollbar for the Emacs mode line. 

For graphical window systems:

and in terminals:

# Why

Emacs has so many great ways to navigate, I really only ever used scrollbars as a visual indication of position and file size.  But recently, to save space, I added `(scroll-bar-mode -1)` to my init.  Immediately I missed having that information at a glance.  A percentage in the mode line (like `25%`) is not very glanceable, and also gives no information about the total line length.  I wanted something very fast and very light weight, plus I'm not so into [rainbow cats](https://github.com/TeMPOraL/nyan-mode).

# Info

- Uses [_specified space_](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Specified-Space.html) for drawing (only 3 variable-width spaces, actually) for lightning-fast text-based mode line scroll.
- Computes line numbers with caching for performance.
- Works in terminals! Terminal graphics are more granular (the minimum "pixel" is a character wide).  You might want to increase `mlscroll-width-chars` there. 
- In graphical Emacs, you can click, click + drag, and wheel-scroll a full window height at a time on the mode line scroll bar.
- Clicking on an inactive window's mode line scroll bar does not activate it. 
- By default, MLScroll disables the `XX%` position mode line indication.
- MLScroll puts itself in the mode line variable `mode-line-end-spaces`, prepending a spacer to right align itself.
- Use `M-x customize-group mlscroll` to change background colors, overall scroll bar width, minimum current "thumb" width, border size, and other settings.
- `which-function-mode` by default puts `[full-function-name]` on the right of the mode line.  With long names this can push the scroll bar off the right side of the mode line.  Set `mlscroll-shortfun-min-width` to a minimum width, and MLScroll will truncate the function name to at least that many trailing characters (`[â€¦function-name]` or similar). 

# Lines vs. Characters

The MLScroll bar widths are based on the number of _lines_ visible in the window (+ lines before and after it). The normal scroll bar is based on _characters_ shown. Both tend to change as very long/wrapped lines come into view, but in the opposite sense: MLScroll sees fewer lines shown and shrinks the current thumb; the default scrollbar sees many characters come in view, and increases it.  I find lines to be more sensible, and it has the advantage that with `truncate-lines` on, it doesn't change as you scroll.  If you'd like to see the difference, evaluate `(insert (make-string 5000 ?a) "\n")` in the `*scratch*` buffer amidst other normal text, and scroll through before and after `toggle-truncate-lines`.

# Installing

Get it wherever you get your favorite packages, and arrange to have 

```elisp
(mlscroll-mode 1)
```

called at init time (or whenever you are feeling scrolly). Toggle on or off anytime.
